#include <Swiften/Version.h>

/*
 * Define macros for Swiften compatible shared pointer and signal namespaces.
 *
 * Using these it is possible to declare shared pointers and signals like this:
 *
 * SWIFTEN_SIGNAL_NAMESPACE::signal signal;
 * SWIFTEN_SHRPTR_NAMESPACE::shared_ptr<Type> ptr;
 *
 * These are guaranteed to be the same implementation as Swift uses internally,
 * thus can be used when passign/retrieveing data from/to swiften.
 *
 * This is due to Swift 4 moved from boost::shared_ptr to SWIFTEN_SHRPTR_NAMESPACE::shared_ptr
 * and from boost::signals to boost::signals2 .
