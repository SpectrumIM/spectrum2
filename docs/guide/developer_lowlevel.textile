This page is useful only if you want to write backend in a language for which there's no NetworkPlugin class ready or if you just want to know what protocol Spectrum 2 uses to communicate with backends.

h2. Packets

Spectrum 2 main instance and its backends communicate using TCP socket. Packets sent over this socket are serialized using Google Protobuf library. This library has bindings (unofficial) for many programming languages.

Packets look like this:

|_. Byte|_. Description|
|0-4| Length of payload sent in this packet in network byte order as generated by uint32_t htonl(uint32_t hostlong); method.|
|4-x| WrapperMessage payload serialized using Google Protobuf.|

h3. WrapperMessage payload

This Protobuf object is used to contain payloads of different types. Every payload type has its own type and Protobuf object representing it. All payloads are explained later in this document.

All objects which can be used as payload in WrapperMessage object are declared in "include/transport/protocol.proto":https://github.com/hanzz/libtransport/blob/master/include/transport/protocol.proto.

h2. Spawning the backend

1. Spectrum 2 main instance spawns the backend when it's needed. Backend is executed with following arguments: @"--host localhost --port 32453"@.
2. Backend has to initalize itself and connect the Spectrum 2 main instance using @host@ and @port@.
3. Spectrum 2 main instance sends packet with payload of TYPE_PING (stored in WrapperMessage object).
4. Backend answers the TYPE_PING payload with TYPE_PONG payload and since the requests are forwarded to it.

h2. User wants to login the legacy network

1. @Type: TYPE_LOGIN, Payload: Login@ packet is sent to backend, backend starts connecting the user to legacy network.
2. When the user is connected, it populates his roster using @Type: TYPE_BUDDY_CHANGED, Payload: Buddy@ packets.
3. It sends @Type: TYPE_CONNECTED, Payload: Connected@ packet to Spectrum 2 main instance to inform it that user is connected to legacy network.

If something goes bad during the login process or later, backend sends @Type: TYPE_DISCONNECTED, Payload: Disconnected@ packet at any time.

h2. User wants to join the room

1. @Type: TYPE_JOIN_ROOM, Payload: Room@ packet is sent to backend, backend starts joining the user to the room.
2. Backend populates room's participant list using @Type: TYPE_PARTICIPANT_CHANGED, Payload: Participant@ packets. As last Participant it has to send the user itself.
3. Backend can change room subject using @Type: TYPE_ROOM_SUBJECT_CHANGED, Payload: ConversationMessage@.

h2. WrapperMessage payloads sent by Spectrum 2 main instance

This chapter describes all possible payloads which can be sent by Spectrum 2 main instance to backend and therefore received by backend. It also describes what should backend do when it receives payload of that type and what should sends back to Spectrum 2 main instance.
