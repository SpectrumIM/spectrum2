### Chat Room

We have a chat room at [spectrum@conference.spectrum.im](xmpp:spectrum@conference.spectrum.im?join). To join it using your browser, [click here](http://slack.spectrum.im/chat). This is the preferred way of
contacting the developers. If you ask question there, stay in the room for a while. We have also our own life and we are not paying
attention to the room 24 hours per day.
