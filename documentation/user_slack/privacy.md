## Our Slack privacy policy

We are open-source project - if you don't like these privacy policy, you can always host Spectrum 2 on your own machine and own all your data.

### Information we collect and receive

We receive information about your Slack team, profile information, and messages from your channels.

Messages are not stored or analysed, they are just forwarded from one network to another.

Passwords for 3rd-party network accounts are stored in a format allowing us to get the plain-text password you enter back. This is needed, because the 3rd-party networks
request us to use plain-text passwords.

We also store contact list of 3rd-party network accounts.

### How we use your information

We use information you provide to authenticate you and deliver message content to you and from you and your Slack team.

Your team's data will not be shared with 3rd parties.
