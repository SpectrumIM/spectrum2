  RELEASE-NOTES: NSS can be used for metalink hashing

- [Fabian Keil brought this change]

  Get test 2032 working when using valgrind
  
  If curl_multi_fdset() sets maxfd to -1, the socket detection
  loop is skipped and thus !found_new_socket is no cause for alarm.

- test2032: spurious failure caused by premature termination

  Fix comment typos in test 517

- [Fabian Keil brought this change]

  Test 92 and 194: normalize spaces in the Server headers
  
  It makes no difference from curl's point of view but
  makes it more convenient to use the tests with a
  lws-normalizing proxy between curl and the test server.

- [Fabian Keil brought this change]

  Add a HOSTIP precheck for tests 31 and 1105
  
  They currently only work for 127.0.0.1 which
  is hardcoded and can't be easily changed.

- [Fabian Keil brought this change]

  Let test 8 work as long as %HOSTIP ends with ".0.0.1"
  
  .. and add a precheck to skip the test otherwise.

- [Fabian Keil brought this change]

  Add --resolve to the keywords and name of test 1318
  
  This makes it easier to skip it automatically when
  the test suite is used with external proxies.

- [Fabian Keil brought this change]

  Add FTP keywords for a couple of currently keyword-less FTP tests

- [Fabian Keil brought this change]

  Add keywords for a couple of currently keyword-less HTTP tests

- [Fabian Keil brought this change]

  Use carriage returns in all headers in test 31
  
  Trailing spaces were left unmodifed, assuming they were intentional.

- [Fabian Keil brought this change]

  Do not mix CRLF and LF header endings in a couple of HTTP tests
  
  Consistently use CRLF instead. The mixed endings weren't
  documented so I assume they were unintentional.
  
  This change doesn't matter for curl itself but makes using
  the tests with a proxy between curl and the test server
  more convenient.
  
  Tests that consistently use no carriage returns were
  left unmodified as one can easily work around this.

- fixed memory leak: CURLOPT_RESOLVE with multi interface
  
  DNS cache entries populated with CURLOPT_RESOLVE were not properly freed
  again when done using the multi interface.
  
  Test case 1502 added to verify.

- mem-include-scan: verify memory #includes
  
  If we use memory functions (malloc, free, strdup etc) in C sources in
  libcurl and we fail to include curl_memory.h or memdebug.h we either
  fail to properly support user-provided memory callbacks or the memory
  leak system of the test suite fails.
  
  After Ajit's report of a failure in the first category in http_proxy.c,
  I spotted a few in the second category as well. These problems are now
  tested for by test 1132 which runs a perl program that scans for and
  attempts to check that we use the correct include files if a memory
  related function is used in the source code.

- autoconf: don't force-disable compiler debug option
  
  When nothing is told to configure, we should not enforce switching off
  debug options with -g0 (or similar). We instead don't use -g at all in
  that situaion and therefore allow the user's CFLAGS settings possibly
  dictate what to do.

- tool_metalink: fix error detection of hash alg initialization
  
  The {MD5,SHA1,SHA256}_Init functions from OpenSSL are called directly
  without any wrappers and they return 1 for success, 0 otherwise.  Hence,
  we have to use the same approach in all the wrapper functions that are
  used for the other crypto libraries.
  
  This commit fixes a regression introduced in commit dca8ae5f.

  Digst: Add microseconds into nounce calculation
  
  When using only 1 second precision, curl doesn't create new cnonce
  values quickly enough for all uses.
  
  For example, issuing the following command multiple times to a recent
  Tomcat causes authentication failures:
  
  curl --digest -utest:test http://tomcat.test.com:8080/manager/list
  
  This is because curl uses the same cnonce for several seconds, but
  doesn't increment the nonce counter.  Tomcat correctly interprets
  this as a replay attack and rejects the request.
  
  When microsecond-precision is available, this commit causes curl to
  change cnonce values much more frequently.
  
  With microsecond resolution, increasing the nounce length used in the
  headers to 32 was made to further reduce the risk of duplication.

- SCP/SFTP: improve error code used for send failures
  
  Instead of relying on the generic CURLE error for SCP or SFTP send
  failures, try passing back a more suitable error if possible.

  SSL: Several SSL-backend related fixes
  
  axTLS:
  
  This will make the axTLS backend perform the RFC2818 checks, honoring
  the VERIFYHOST setting similar to the OpenSSL backend.
  
  Generic for OpenSSL and axTLS:
  
  Move the hostcheck and cert_hostcheck functions from the lib/ssluse.c
  files to make them genericly available for both the OpenSSL, axTLS and
  other SSL backends. They are now in the new lib/hostcheck.c file.
  
  CyaSSL:
  
  CyaSSL now also has the RFC2818 checks enabled by default. There is a
  limitation that the verifyhost can not be enabled exclusively on the
  Subject CN field comparison. This SSL backend will thus behave like the
  NSS and the GnuTLS (meaning: RFC2818 ok, or bust). In other words:
  setting verifyhost to 0 or 1 will disable the Subject Alt Names checks
  too.
  
  Schannel:
  
  Updated the schannel information messages: Split the IP address usage
  message from the verifyhost setting and changed the message about
  disabling SNI (Server Name Indication, used in HTTP virtual hosting)
  into a message stating that the Subject Alternative Names checks are
  being disabled when verifyhost is set to 0 or 1. As a side effect of
  switching off the RFC2818 related servername checks with
  SCH_CRED_NO_SERVERNAME_CHECK
  (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa923430.aspx) the SNI feature
  is being disabled. This effect is not documented in MSDN, but Wireshark
  output clearly shows the effect (details on the libcurl maillist).
  
  PolarSSL:
  
  Fix the prototype change in PolarSSL of ssl_set_session() and the move
  of the peer_cert from the ssl_context to the ssl_session. Found this
  change in the PolarSSL SVN between r1316 and r1317 where the
  POLARSSL_VERSION_NUMBER was at 0x01010100. But to accommodate the Ubuntu
  PolarSSL version 1.1.4 the check is to discriminate between lower then
  PolarSSL version 1.2.0 and 1.2.0 and higher. Note: The PolarSSL SVN
  trunk jumped from version 1.1.1 to 1.2.0.
  
  Generic:
  
  All the SSL backends are fixed and checked to work with the
  ssl.verifyhost as a boolean, which is an internal API change.

- libcurl: VERSIONINFO update

- Curl_readwrite: remove debug output
  
  The text "additional stuff not fine" text was added for debug purposes a

  present and thus (far too many) users get to read this info.

  check.

  in 473003fbdf.
  
  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=3581898

- URL parser: cut off '#' fragments from URLs (better)
  
  The existing logic only cut off the fragment from the separate 'path'
  buffer which is used when sending HTTP to hosts. The buffer that held
  the full URL used for proxies were not dealt with. It is now.
  
  Test case 5 was updated to use a fragment on a URL over a proxy.

- test 2027/2030: take duplicate Digest requests into account
  
  With the reversion of ce8311c7e49eca and the new clear logic, this flaw
  is present and we allow it.

- Curl_pretransfer: clear out unwanted auth methods
  
  As a handle can be re-used after having done HTTP auth in a previous
  request, it must make sure to clear out the HTTP types that aren't
  wanted in this new request.

- test1412: verify Digest with repeated URLs
  
  This test case verifies that bug 3582718 is fixed.
  
  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=3582718
  Reported by: Nick Zitzmann (originally)

- Revert "Zero out auth structs before transfer"
  
  This reverts commit ce8311c7e49eca93c136b58efa6763853541ec97.
  
  The commit made test 2024 work but caused a regression with repeated
  Digest authentication. We need to fix this differently.

- CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST: stop supporting the 1 value
  
  After a research team wrote a document[1] that found several live source
  codes out there in the wild that misused the CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST
  option thinking it was a boolean, this change now bans 1 as a value and
  will make libcurl return error for it.
  
  1 was never a sensible value to use in production but was introduced
  back in the days to help debugging. It was always documented clearly
  this way.
  
  1 was never supported by all SSL backends in libcurl, so this cleanup
  makes the treatment of it unified.
  
  The report's list of mistakes for this option were all PHP code and
  while there's a binding layer between libcurl and PHP, the PHP team has
  decided that they have an as thin layer as possible on top of libcurl so
  they will not alter or specifically filter a 'TRUE' value for this
  particular option. I sympathize with that position.

  As pointed out in Bug report #3579064, curl_multi_perform() would

  could lead to for example a very long block if the LIST response never
  showed.
  
  The solution was to make sure to properly continue to use the multi
  interface non-blocking state machine.
  
  The new test 1501 verifies the fix.

  Do not fill the decrypted data buffer with more data unless

- curl_schannel: Removed buffer limit and optimized buffer strategy
  
  Since there are servers that seem to return very big encrypted
  data packages, we need to be able to handle those without having
  an internal size limit. To avoid the buffer growing to fast to

  in the buffer was decreased as well.

- multi_runsingle: CURLOPT_LOW_SPEED_* fix for rate limitation
  
  During the periods of rate limitation, the speedcheck function wasn't
  called and thus the values weren't updated accordingly and it would then
  easily trigger wrongly once data got transferred again.
  
  Also, the progress callback's return code was not acknowledged in this
  state so it could make an "abort" return code to get ignored and not
  have the documented effect of aborting an ongoing transfer.

  tool_metalink.c: Filtered resource URLs by type
  
  In Metalink v3, the type attribute of url element indicates the
  type of the resource the URL points to. It can include URL to the
  meta data, such as BitTorrent metainfo file.  In Curl, we are not
  interested in these meta data URLs. Instead, we are only
  interested in the HTTP and FTP URLs. This change filters out
  non-HTTP and FTP URLs. If we don't filter out them, it will be
  downloaded by curl and hash check will fail if hash is provided
  and next URL will be tried. This change will cut this useless
  network transfer.

- tool_metalink.c: Added name of validation hash to messages
  
  This makes it easier to debug broken hashes or hash functions.

- wincrypt: Fixed cross-compilation issues caused by include name
  
  For some reason WinCrypt.h is named wincrypt.h under MinGW.

- md5.c: Added support for Microsoft Windows CryptoAPI

- Makefile.m32: Updated to build against libmetalink 0.1.2
  
  The include and library path were moved within libmetalink, this
  patch adjusts the defaults provided within the curl MinGW makefile.

- tool_metalink.c: Added support for Microsoft Windows CryptoAPI
  
  Since Metalink support requires a crypto library for hash functions
  and Windows comes with the builtin CryptoAPI, this patch adds that
  API as a fallback to the supported crypto libraries.
  It is automatically used on Windows if no other library is provided.

- libntlmconnect.c: Fixed typo and conversion

- libntlmconnect.c: Fixed warning: curl_easy_getinfo expects long pointer

  curl_easy_getinfo expects a pointer to long for this info

- sws.c: Fixed warning: 'err' may be used uninitialized in this function

- libntlmconnect.c: Fixed warning: comparison of signed/unsigned integer
  
  Windows does not use -1 to represent invalid sockets and the
  SOCKET type is unsigned.

- nss.c: Fixed warning: 'err' may be used uninitialized in this function

- tool_metalink.c: Fixed error: 'O_BINARY' undeclared
  
  Check for O_BINARY which is not available on every system.

- tool_metalink.c: Fixed validation of binary files containing EOF
  
  Since Windows/MinGW threat 0x1A as the EOF character, reading binary
  files which contain that byte does not work using text mode.
  The read function will only read until the first 0x1A byte. This
  means that the hash is not computed from the whole file and the
  final validation check using hash comparision fails.

- winbuild: Added support for building with SPNEGO enabled
  
  Since Simple and Protected GSSAPI Negotiation Mechanism
  is already implemented in curl and supported by the MinGW
  builds, this change adds build support to winbuild makefiles.

- winbuild: Adjusted order of options to generated config name
  
  Cleaned up order of handled build options by ordering them
  nearly alphabetically by using the order of the generated
  config name. Preparation for future/more build options.

  ftp: active conn, place calling sockopt callback at the end of function
  
  Commit b91d29a28e170c16d65d956db79f2cd3a82372d2 introduces a bug and breaks Curl_closesocket function. sock_accepted flag for the second socket should be tagged as TRUE before the sockopt callback is called because in case the callback returns an error, Curl_closesocket function is going to call the - fclosesocket - callback for the accept()ed socket

- [Gokhan Sengun brought this change]

  ftp: active conn, allow application to set sockopt after accept() call
  
  For active FTP connections, applications may need setting the sockopt after accept() call returns successful. This fix gives a call to the callback registered with CURL_SOCKOPTFUNCTION option. Also a new sock type - CURLSOCKTYPE_ACCEPT - is added. This type is to be passed to application callbacks with - purpose - parameter. Applications may use this parameter to distinguish between socket types.

- configure: remove the --enable/disable-nonblocking options
  
  Removing this option as it currently only functions to lure people into

- bump version to 7.28.0
  
  I am about to merge the first patch that adds changes into the pending

- RELEASE-NOTES: added missing link

- curl_version: fixed Value stored to 'len' is never read
  
  Fixed this (harmless) clang-analyzer warning. Also fixed the source
  indentation level.

- TODO-RELEASE: the (nil) bug is fixed

- add_next_timeout: minor restructure of code
  
  By reading the ->head pointer and using that instead of the ->size
  number to figure out if there's a list remaining we avoid the (false
  positive) clang-analyzer warning that we might dereference of a null
  pointer.

- verbose messages: fixed output of hostnames in re-used connections
  
  I suspect this is a regression introduced in commit 207cf150, included
  since 7.24.0.
  
  Avoid showing '(nil)' as hostname in verbose output by making sure the
  hostname fixup function is called early enough to set the pointers that
  are used for this. The name data is set again for each request even for
  re-used connections to handle multiple hostnames over the same
  connection (like with proxy) or that the casing etc of the host name is
  changed between requests (which has proven to be important at least once
  in the past).
  
  Test1011 was modified to use a redirect with a re-used a connection
  since it then showed the bug and now lo longer does. There's currently
  no easy way to have the test suite detect 'nil' texts in verbose ouputs
  so no tests will detect if this problem gets reintroduced.

- Curl_socket_check: fix timeout return value for select users
  
  This is the same fix applied for the conditional code that uses select()
  that was already done for the poll specific code in commit
  b61e8b81f5038.

- [Maxime Larocque brought this change]

  Curl_socket_check: fix return code for timeout
  
  We found a problem with ftp transfer using libcurl (7.23 and 7.25)
  inside an application which is receiving unix signals (SIGUSR1,
  SIGUSR2...) almost continuously. (Linux 2.4, PowerPC, HAVE_POLL_FINE
  defined).
  
  Curl_socket_check() uses poll() to wait for the socket, and retries it
  when a signal is received (EINTR). However, if a signal is received and
  it also happens that the timeout has been reached, Curl_socket_check()
  returns -1 instead of 0 (indicating an error instead of a timeout).
  
  In our case, the result is an aborted connection even before the ftp
  banner is received from the server, and a return value of
  CURLE_OUT_OF_MEMORY from curl_easy_perform() (Curl_pp_multi_statemach(),
  in pingpong.c, actually returns OOM if Curl_socket_check() fails :-)
  Funny to debug on a system on which OOM is a possible cause).

Joe Mason (3 Aug 2012)
- Add tests of auth retries

- Cleanup handshake after clean NTLM failure

- Zero out auth structs before transfer

- Add a polling loop in main to read from more than one socket at once. Add the O_NONBLOCK and
  SO_KEEPALIVE flag to all sockets. Note that several loops which used to continue on a return value
  of 0 (theoretical since 0 would never be returned without O_NONBLOCK) now break on 0 so that they
  won't continue reading until after poll is called again.

- Change return values of get_request, accept_connection and service_connection to add a return code
  for non-blocking sockets: now -1 means error or connection finished, 1 means data was read, and 0
  means there is no data available now so need to wait for poll (new return value)

- Hoist the loop out of get_request, and make sure that it can be reentered when a request is
  half-finished.
  
  Note the the req struct used to be re-initialized AFTER reading pipeline data, so now that we
  initialize it from the caller we must be careful not to overwrite the pipeline data.
  
  Also we now need to handle the case where the buffer is already full when get_request is called -
  previously this never happened as it was always called with an empty buffer and looped until done.
  
  Now get_request is called in a loop, so the next step is to run the loop on a socket only when poll
  signals it is readable.

- Move blocks of code from the sws main loop into their own functions for easier refactoring later.
  The next step will be to call the correct function after a poll, rather than looping unconditionally

- Remove the --fork option of sws, since it makes refactoring to use poll more complicated and should
  be redundant once we poll

- tests: verify the stricter numeric option parser
  
  Test 1409 and 1410 verifies the stricter numeric option parser
  introduced the other day in commit f2b6ebed7b.

- SWS: use of uninitialized memory fix
  
  I made "connmon" not get initialized properly before use, and I use the
  big hammer and make sure we always clear the entire struct to avoid any
  problem like this in the future.

- test48: verify that HEAD doesn't close extra
  
  Two commits ago, we fixed a bug where the connction would be closed
  prematurely after a HEAD. Now I added connection-monitor to test 48 and
  added a second HEAD and make sure that both are sent over the same
  connection.
  
  This triggered a failure before the bug fix and now works. Will help us
  avoid a future regression of this kind.

- connection-monitor: always log disconnect when enabled
  
  This makes verifying easier and makes us more sure curl closes the
  connection only at the correct point in time. Adjusted test 206 and 1008
  accordingly and updated the docs for it.

- HEAD: don't force-close after response-headers
  
  A HEAD response has no body length and gets the headers like the
  corresponding GET would so it should not get closed after the response
  based on the same rules. This mistake caused connections that did HEAD
  to get closed too often without a valid reason.

- test 46: use different path lengths to get reliable sort order
  
  Since the order of the cookies is sorted by the length of the paths,
  having them on the same path length will make the test depend on what
  order the qsort() implementation will put them. As seen in the
  windows/msys output posted by Guenter in this posting:
  http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2012-07/0105.html

- cookie: fixed typo in comment

- [Christian Hägele brought this change]

  https_getsock: provided for schannel backend as well
  
  The function https_getsock was only implemented properly when USE_SSLEAY
  or USE_GNUTLS is defined, but it is also necessary for USE_SCHANNEL.
  
  The problem occurs when Curl_read_plain or Curl_write_plain returns
  CURLE_AGAIN. In that case CURL_OK is returned to the multi-interface an
  the used socket is set to state CURL_POLL_REMOVE and the easy-state is
  set to CURLM_STATE_PROTOCONNECT. This is fine, because later the socket
  should be set to CURL_POLL_IN or CURL_POLL_OUT via multi_getsock. That's
  where https_getsock is called and doesn't return any sockets.

- winbuild: Aligned BUILD.WINDOWS.txt and Makefile.vc usage help

- winbuild: Make USE_WINSSL depend on USE_SSPI
  
  Since WinSSL cannot be build without SSPI being enabled,
  USE_WINSSL now defaults to the value of USE_SSPI.
  
  The makefile does now raise an error if WinSSL is enabled
  while SSPI is disabled.

- winbuild: Aligned USE_SSPI with other USE_x defines
  
  Renamed external parameter USE_SSPI = yes/no to ENABLE_SSPI = yes/no.
  Backwards compatible change: USE_SSPI can still be passed as external
  parameter with yes/no value as long as ENABLE_SSPI is not given.
  
  USE_x defines are passed around with true/false values internally,
  USE_SSPI is now aligned to this approach, but still accepts external
  values yes/no being passed, just like the other defines.

- winbuild: Clean up formatting and variable naming
  
  - Changed space usage to line up with the whole file
  - Renamed CFLAGS_SSPI/IPV6 to SSPI/IPV6_CFLAGS to be
    consistent with the other CFLAGS_x variables

    instead of appending directly to CFLAGS

  darwinssl: output cipher with text, remove SNI warning
  
  The code was printing a warning when SNI was set up successfully. Oops.
  
  Printing the cipher number in verbose mode was something only TLS/SSL
  programmers might understand, so I had it print the name of the cipher,
  just like in the OpenSSL code. That'll be at least a little bit easier
  to understand. The SecureTransport API doesn't have a method of getting
  a string from a cipher like OpenSSL does, so I had to generate the
  strings manually.

- tests: use connection-monitor and verify results
  
  Test 1008 and 206 don't show the disconnect since it happens when SWS
  awaits a new request, but 503 does and so the verify section needs that
  string added.

- http-proxy: keep CONNECT connections alive (for NTLM)
  
  When doing CONNECT requests, libcurl must make sure the connection is
  alive as much as possible. NTLM requires it and it is generally good for
  other cases as well.
  
  NTLM over CONNECT requests has been broken since this regression I
  introduced in my CONNECT cleanup commits that started with 41b02378342,
  included since 7.25.0.
  
  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/bug/view.cgi?id=3538625
  Reported by: Marcel Raad

- sws: support <servercmd> for CONNECT requests
  
  I moved out the servercmd parsing into a its own function called
  parse_servercmd() and made sure it gets used also when the test number
  is extracted from CONNECT requests. It turned out sws didn't do that
  previously!

- FILEFORMAT: provided a full description of connection-monitor

- lib503: enable verbose to ease debugging this

- sws: add 'connection-monitor' command support
  
  Using this, the server will output in the protocol log when the
  connection gets disconnected and thus we will verify correctly in the
  test cases that the connection doesn't get closed prematurely. This is
  important for example NTLM to work.
  
  Documentation added to FILEFORMAT, test 503 updated to use this.

  The noprogress and isatty in Configurable are global, in a sense

  and they are not restored on successive downloads.  This change
  first backups the current noprogress and isatty, and restores
  them when download does not write its data to tty.

- [Tatsuhiro Tsujikawa brought this change]

  curl: Made --metalink option toggle Metalink functionality
  
  In this change, --metalink option no longer takes argument.  If
  it is specified, given URIs are processed as Metalink XML file.
  If given URIs are remote (e.g., http URI), curl downloads it
  first. Regardless URI is local file (e.g., file URI scheme) or
  remote, Metalink XML file is not written to local file system and
  the received data is fed into Metalink XML parser directly.  This
  means with --metalink option, filename related options like -O
  and -o are ignored.
  
  Usage examples:
  
  $ curl --metalink http://example.org/foo.metalink
  
  This will download foo.metalink and parse it and then download
  the URI described there.
  
  $ curl --metalink file://foo.metalink
  
  This will parse local file foo.metalink and then download the URI
  described there.

  curl: Refactored metalink_checksum
  
  When creating metalink_checksum from metalink_checksum_t, first

  match will be chosen (strongest hash function available).  As a
  result, the metalinkfile now only contains at most one
  metalink_checksum because other entries are just redundant.

  http://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2012-06/0255.html
  
  It updates the two remaining reallocations that have already been there
  and fixes the other one to use the same "do we need to increase the
  buffer"-condition as the other two.  CURL_SCHANNEL_BUFFER_STEP_SIZE was
  renamed to CURL_SCHANNEL_BUFFER_FREE_SIZE since that is actually what it
  is now.  Since we don't know how much more data we are going to read
  during the handshake, CURL_SCHANNEL_BUFFER_FREE_SIZE is used as the
  minimum free space required in the buffer for the next operation.
  CURL_SCHANNEL_BUFFER_STEP_SIZE was used for that before, too, but since
  we don't have a step size now, the define was renamed.

  winbuild: Allow SSPI build with or without Schannel

- MakefileBuild.vc: Allow building without SSL
  
  In order to use Windows native SSL support define 'USE_WINSSL'

- configure: new option --with-winssl
  
  This option may be used to build curl/libcurl using SSL/TLS support provided
  by MS windows system libraries. Option is mutually exclusive with any other
  SSL library. Default value is --without-winssl.
  
  --with-winssl option implies --with-sspi option.
  
  Option meaningful only for Windows builds.

Guenter Knauf (13 Jun 2012)
- Changed Schannel string to SSL-Windows-native.
  
  This is more descriptive for the user who might
  not even know what schannnel is at all.

Yang Tse (13 Jun 2012)
- schannel: remove version number and identify its use with 'schannel' literal
  
  Version number is removed in order to make this info consistent with
  how we do it with other MS and Linux system libraries for which we don't
  provide this info.
  
  Identifier changed from 'WinSSPI' to 'schannel' given that this is the
  actual provider of the SSL/TLS support. libcurl can still be built with
  SSPI and without SCHANNEL support.

Daniel Stenberg (12 Jun 2012)
- singlesocket: remove dead code
  
  No need to check if 'entry' is non-NULL in a spot where it is already checked
  and guaranteed to be non-NULL.
  
  (Spotted by a Coverity scan)

- netrc: remove dead code
  
  Remove two states from the enum and the corresponding code for them as
  these states were never reached or used.

- socks_sspi.c: further cleanup

- [Marc Hoersken brought this change]

  socks_sspi.c: Clean up and removal of obsolete minor status
  
  Removed obsolete minor status variable and parameter of status function
  which was never used or set at all. Also Curl_sspi_strerror does support
  only one status and there is no need for a second sub status.

Guenter Knauf (12 Jun 2012)

  schema and complicated the parameters. For now Schannel will be enabled
  if SSPI is enabled and OpenSSL is disabled.

  version: Replaced SSPI feature information with version string details
  
  Added Windows SSPI version information to the curl version string when
  SCHANNEL SSL is not enabled, as the version of the library should also
  be included when SSPI is used to generate security contexts.
  
  Removed SSPI from the feature list as the features are GSS-Negotiate,
  NTLM and SSL depending on the usage of the SSPI library.

- [Steve Holme brought this change]

  sspi.c: Post Curl_sspi_version() rework code tidy up
  
  Removed duplicate blank lines.
  Removed spaces between the not and test in various if statements.
  Removed explicit test of NULL in an if statement.
  Placed function returns on same line as function declarations.
  Replaced the use of curl_maprintf() with aprintf() as it is the
  preprocessor job to do this substitution if ENABLE_CURLX_PRINTF
  is set.

- [Steve Holme brought this change]

  sspi: Reworked Curl_sspi_version() to return version components
  
  Reworked the version function to return four version components rather
  than a string that has to be freed by the caller.

  configure.ac: Added -lversion if built with SSPI

- [Marc Hoersken brought this change]

  schannel: Code cleanup and bug fixes
  
  curl_sspi.c: Fixed mingw32-gcc compiler warnings
  curl_sspi.c: Fixed length of error code hex output
  
  The hex value was printed as signed 64-bit value on 64-bit systems:
  SEC_E_WRONG_PRINCIPAL (0xFFFFFFFF80090322)
  
  It is now correctly printed as the following:
  SEC_E_WRONG_PRINCIPAL (0x80090322)
  
  curl_sspi.c: Fallback to security function table version number
  Instead of reporting an unknown version, the interface version is used.
  
  curl_sspi.c: Removed SSPI/ version prefix from Curl_sspi_version
  curl_schannel: Replaced static buffer sizes with defined names
  curl_schannel.c: First brace when declaring functions on column 0
  curl_schannel.c: Put the pointer sign directly at variable name
  curl_schannel.c: Use structs directly instead of typedef'ed structs

  sspi: Refactored socks_sspi and schannel to use same error message functions
  
  Moved the error constant switch to curl_sspi.c and added two new helper
  functions to curl_sspi.[ch] which either return the constant or a fully
  translated message representing the SSPI security status.
  Updated socks_sspi.c and curl_schannel.c to use the new functions.

- [Marc Hoersken brought this change]

  schannel: Added special shutdown check for Windows 2000 Professional
  
  Windows 2000 Professional:  Schannel returns SEC_E_OK instead
  of SEC_I_CONTEXT_EXPIRED. If the length of the output buffer
  is zero and the first byte of the encrypted packet is 0x15,
  the application can safely assume that the message was a
  close_notify message and change the return value to
  SEC_I_CONTEXT_EXPIRED.
  
  Connection shutdown does not mean that there is no data to read
  Correctly handle incomplete message and ask curl to re-read
  Fixed buffer for decrypted being to small
  Re-structured read condition to be more effective
  Removed obsolete verbose messages
  Changed memory reduction method to keep a minimum buffer of size 4096

  connect.c/ftp.c: Fixed dereferencing pointer breakin strict-aliasing
  
  Fixed warning: dereferencing pointer does break strict-aliasing rules
  by using a union instead of separate pointer variables.
  Internal union sockaddr_u could probably be moved to generic header.
  Thanks to Paul Howarth for the hint about using unions for this.
  
  Important for winbuild: Separate declaration of sockaddr_u pointer.
  The pointer variable *sock cannot be declared and initialized right
  after the union declaration. Therefore it has to be a separate statement.

- sasl: Moved cram-md5 authentication message creation from smtp.c
  
  Moved the cram-md5 message creation from smtp.c into the sasl module
  to allow for use by other modules such as pop3.

- pop3: Fixed an issue with changes introduced in commit c267c53017bc
  
  Because pop3_endofresp() is called for each line of data yet is not
  passed the line and line length, so we have to use the data pointed to
  by pp->linestart_resp which contains the whole packet, the mechanisms
  were being detected in one call yet the function would be called for
  each line of data.
  
  Using curl with verbose mode enabled would show that one line of data
  would be received in response to the AUTH command, before the AUTH
  <mechanism> command was sent to the server and then the next few lines
  of the original AUTH command would be displayed before the response from
  the AUTH <mechanism> command. This would then cause problems when
  parsing the CRAM-MD5 challenge data as extra data was contained in the
  buffer.
  
  Changed the parsing so that each line is checked for the mechanisms
  and the function returns FALSE until the whole of the AUTH response has
  been processed.

- DOCS: Fixed list in Section 18.2 not displaying correctly on web site

- DOCS: Corrected missed heading renumbering from commit 530675a1ad7

- DOCS: Added IMAP and LDAP sections
  
  Added new sections 11. IMAP and 12. LDAP to document adding SASL based
  authentication.
  
  Renumbered current sections 11 to 17 as 13 to 19.
  
  Additionally added 19.10 Add CURLOPT_MAIL_CLIENT option.

- sasl.c: Fix to avoid warnings introduced in commit d9ca9e9869e8
  
  Applied a fix to avoid warnings on systems where Curl_ntlm_sspi_cleanup()
  is just a nop.

- pop3.c:Corrected typo in commit 69ba0da8272d

- pop3: Fixed the issue of having to supply the user name for all requests
  
  Previously it wasn't possible to connect to POP3 and not specify the
  user name as a CURLE_ACCESS_DENIED error would be returned. This error
  occurred because USER would be sent to the server with a blank user name
  if no mailbox user was specified as the server would reply with -ERR.
  
  This wasn't a problem prior to the 7.26.0 release but with the
  introduction of custom commands the user and/or application developer
  might want to issue a CAPA command without having to log in as a
  specific mailbox user.
  
  Additionally this fix won't send the newly introduced AUTH command if no
  user name is specified.

- pop3.c: Small code tidy up
  
  Corrected lines exceeding 78 characters.
  
  Repositioned some comments and added extra clarity.

- sasl: Corrected variable names in comments and parameters

  This is done introducing tags <file1> to <file4> besides existing <file> one,
  as well as corresponding <stripfile1> to <stripfile4> ones, that can be used
  in the <verify> section in the same way as the non-numbered ones.

Steve Holme (31 May 2012)
- sasl: Moved login authentication message creation from smtp.c
  
  Moved the login message creation from smtp.c into the sasl module
  to allow for use by other modules such as pop3.

- smtp.c: Reworked message encoding in smtp_state_authpasswd_resp()
  
  Rather than encoding the password message itself the
  smtp_state_authpasswd_resp() function now delegates the work to the same
  function that smtp_state_authlogin_resp() and smtp_authenticate() use
  when constructing the encoded user name.

- smtp.c: Re-factored smtp_auth_login_user() for use with passwords
  
  In preparation for moving to the SASL module re-factored the
  smtp_auth_login_user() function to smtp_auth_login() so that it can be
  used for both user names and passwords as sending both of these under
  the login authentication mechanism is the same.

- pop3: Added support for sasl plain text authentication

- curl_ntlm_msgs.c: Corrected small spelling mistake in comments

- sasl: Moved plain text authentication message creation from smtp.c
  
  Moved the plain text message creation from smtp.c into the sasl module
  to allow for use by other modules such as pop3.

- configure: fix LDAPS disabling related misplaced closing parenthesis

- pop3 test server: allow pop3 test server verification to succeed again
  
  Introduce SUPPORTCAPA and SUPPORTAUTH config commands to allow further
  pop3 test server expansion for tests that require CAPA or AUTH support,
  although this will need some extra work to make it fully functional.

Steve Holme (28 May 2012)
- pop3: Introduced the continue response in pop3_endofresp()

- pop3: Changed response code from O and E to + and -
  
  The POP3 protocol doesn't really have the concept of error codes and
  uses +, +OK and -ERR in response to commands to indicate continue,
  success and error.
  
  The AUTH command is one of those commands that requires multiple pieces
  of data to be sent to the server where the server will respond with + as
  part of the handshaking. This meant changing the values before
  continuing with the next stage of adding authentication support.

- pop3: Small code tidy up following authentication work so far
  
  Changed the order of the state machine to match the order of actual
  events.
  
  Reworked some comments and function parameter positioning that I missed
  the other day.

- DOCS: Corrected the "Added in" version number for CURLOPT_MAIL_AUTH
  
  Additionally corrected another RFC link that I missed yesterday.

- pop3: Added support for SASL based authentication mechanism detection
  
  Added support for detecting the supported SASL authentication mechanisms
  via the AUTH command. There are two ways of detecting them, either by
  using the AUTH command, that will return -ERR if not supported or by
  using the CAPA command which will return SASL and the list of mechanisms
  if supported, not include SASL if SASL authentication is not supported
  or -ERR if the CAPA command is not supported. As such it seems simpler
  to use the AUTH command and fallback to normal clear text authentication
  if the the command is not supported.
  
  Additionally updated the test cases to return -ERR when the AUTH command
  is encountered. Additional test cases will be added when support for the
  individual authentication mechanisms is added.

Daniel Stenberg (27 May 2012)
- pop3: remove trailing whitespace

Steve Holme (27 May 2012)

- metalink: fix build errors when disabled

- [Tatsuhiro Tsujikawa brought this change]

  Reduced #ifdef HAVE_METALINK

- [Tatsuhiro Tsujikawa brought this change]

  Disable hash check if neither OpenSSL nor GNUTLS is installed.

- [Tatsuhiro Tsujikawa brought this change]

  Minimize usage of structs from libmetalink

- [Tatsuhiro Tsujikawa brought this change]

  Check checksum of downloaded file if checksum is available
  
  Metalink file contains several hash types of checksums, such as
  md5, sha-1, sha-256, etc. To deal with these checksums, I created
  abstraction layer based on lib/curl_md5.h and
  lib/md5.c. Basically, they are almost the same but I changed the
  code so that it is not hash type dependent. Currently,
  GNUTLS(nettle or gcrypt) and OpenSSL functions are supported.
  
  Checksum checking is done by reopening download file.  If there
  is an I/O error, the current implementation just prints error
  message and does not try next resource.
  
  In this patch, the supported hash types are: md5, sha-1 and sha-256.

- [Tatsuhiro Tsujikawa brought this change]

  Always create directory hierarchy for Metalink.
  
  Filenames contained in Metalink file can include directory information.
  Filenames are unique in Metalink file, taking into account the directory
  information. So we need to create the directory hierarchy.
  
  Curl has --create-dirs option, but we create directory hierarchy for
  Metalink downloads regardless of the option value.
  
  This patch also put metalink int variable outside of HAVE_LIBMETALINK
  guard. This reduces the number of #ifdefs.

- [Tatsuhiro Tsujikawa brought this change]

  Fixed segmentation fault when Metalink has no valid file or no resource.

- [Tatsuhiro Tsujikawa brought this change]

  Support media-type parameter in Content-Type

  Print message if --metalink is used while metalink support is not
  enabled. Migrated Metalink support in tool_operate.c and removed
  operatemetalink().

  Applied patches from Daniel

- [Tatsuhiro Tsujikawa brought this change]

  Support Metalink.
  
  This change adds experimental Metalink support to curl.
  To enable Metalink support, run configure with --with-libmetalink.
  To feed Metalink file to curl, use --metalink option like this:
  
    $ curl -O --metalink foo.metalink
  
  We use libmetalink to parse Metalink files.

Daniel Stenberg (25 May 2012)
- [Tatsuhiro Tsujikawa brought this change]

  Made -D option work with -O and -J.
  
  To achieve this, first new structure HeaderData is defined to hold
  necessary data to perform header-related work.  Then tool_header_cb now
  receives HeaderData pointer as userdata.  All header-related work
  (currently, dumping header and Content-Disposition inspection) are done
  in this callback function.  HeaderData.outs->config is used to determine
  whether each work is done.
  
  Unit tests were also updated because after this change, curl code always
  sets CURLOPT_HEADERFUNCTION and CURLOPT_HEADERDATA.
  
  Tested with -O -J -D, -O -J -i and -O -J -D -i and all worked fine.

- URL parse: reject numerical IPv6 addresses outside brackets
  
  Roman Mamedov spotted (in
  http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=670126) that curl would
  not complain when given a URL with an IPv6 numerical address without
  brackets. It would simply cut off the last ":[hex]" part and thus not
  work correctly.
  
  That's a URL using an illegal syntax and now libcurl will instead return
  a clear error code and error message detailing the error.
  
  The above mentioned bug report claims this to be a regression but
  libcurl does not guarantee functionality when given URLs that aren't
  following the URL spec (RFC3986 mostly). I consider the fact that it
  used to handle this differently a mere coincidence.

- -# progress meter: avoid superfluous updates and duplicate lines
  
  By comparing if a different "progress point" is reached or not since the
  previous update, the progress function callback for this now avoids many
  superfluous screen updates. This has the nice side-effect that it fixes
  a problem that causes a second progress meter line.
  
  The second line output happened because when we use the -# progress
  meter, we force a newline output after the transfer in the main loop in
  curl, but when libcurl calls the progress callback from
  curl_easy_cleanup() it would then output the progress display
  again. Possibly the naive newline output is wrong but this optimization
  was suitable anyway...

  OpenSSL: Made cert hostname check conform to RFC 6125
  
  This change replaces RFC 2818 based hostname check in OpenSSL build with
  RFC 6125 [1] based one.
  
  The hostname check in RFC 2818 is ambiguous and each project implements
  it in the their own way and they are slightly different. I check curl,
  gnutls, Firefox and Chrome and they are all different.
  
  I don't think there is a bug in current implementation of hostname
  check. But it is not as strict as the modern browsers do. Currently,
  curl allows multiple wildcard character '*' and it matches '.'. (as
  described in the comment in ssluse.c).
  
  Firefox implementation is also based on RFC 2818 but it only allows at
  most one wildcard character and it must be in the left-most label in the
  pattern and the wildcard must not be followed by any character in the
  label.[2] Chromium implementation is based on RFC 6125 as my patch does.
  Firefox and Chromium both require wildcard in the left-most label in the
  presented identifier.
  
  This patch is more strict than the current implementation, so there may
  be some cases where old curl works but new one does not. But at the same
  time I think it is good practice to follow the modern browsers do and
  follow the newer RFC.

  the previous "known download size" would linger and cause the progress
  meter to get incorrect information, ie the former value would remain
  being sent in. This could easily result in downloads that were WAY
  larger than "expected" and would cause >100% outputs with the curl
  command line tool.
  
  Test case 599 was created and it was used to repeat the bug and then
  verify the fix.

  CURLINFO_RESPONSE_CODE action.

- curl.1: updated --libcurl
  
  With Colin Hogben's recent work, --libcurl now also works with -F and
  more. Remove the previous caveat.

- test: --libcurl fixes
  
  The line endings broke when I saved the three recent patches (my fault,
  not Colin's) to 'git am' them.
  
  Adjusted the stripping of the test program for comparing to also exclude
  the SSH key file name as that will differ and use a local path name.

- [Colin Hogben brought this change]

  Add helper script convsrctest.pl to manipulate --libcurl tests.
  
  The intention is to take the output of curl's --libcurl option,
  as exercised in test 14xx, and generate a corresponding test15xx
  in which the generated code is compiled and run.  This will verify
  that the generated code behaves equivalently to the original
  invocation of the curl command.
  
  The script is not yet integrated into the configure / makefile
  machinery.

- [Colin Hogben brought this change]

  Add tests for curl's --libcurl output.
  
  These tests check the output of the --libcurl option of curl,
  including the improved option handling added in a related patch.

- [Colin Hogben brought this change]

  Generate lists and use symbols in --libcurl code output.
  
  This patch improves the output of curl's --libcurl option by
  generating code which builds curl_httppost and curl_slist lists, and
  uses symbolic names for enum and flag values.  Variants of the
  my_setopt macro in tool_setopt.h are added in order to pass extra type
  information to the code-generation step in tool_setopt.c.
  
  If curl is configured with --disable-libcurl-option then the macros
  call curl_easy_setopt directly.

- [Steve Holme brought this change]

  pop3.c: Fixed drop of final CRLF in EOB checking
  
  Curl_pop3_write() would drop the final CRLF of a message as it was
  considered part of the EOB as opposed to part of the message. Whilst
  the EOB sequence needs to be searched for by the function only the
  final 3 characters should be removed as per RFC-1939 section 3.

  smtp.c: Fixed an issue with the EOB checking
  
  Curl_smtp_escape_eob() would leave off final CRLFs from emails ending

- [Steve Holme brought this change]

  smtp_mail: Added support to MAIL FROM for the optional AUTH parameter
  
  Added a new CURLOPT_MAIL_AUTH option that allows the calling program to
  set the optional AUTH parameter in the MAIL FROM command.
  
  When this option is specified and an authentication mechanism is used
  to communicate with the mail server then the AUTH parameter will be
  included in the MAIL FROM command. This is particularly useful when the
  calling program is acting as a relay in a trusted environment and
  performing server to server communication, as it allows the relaying
  server to specify the address of the mailbox that was used to
  authenticate and send the original email.

  SMTP: Fixed error when using CURLOPT_CONNECT_ONLY
  
  Fixed incorrect behavior in smtp_done() which would cause the end of
  block data to be sent to the SMTP server if libcurl was operating in
  connect only mode. This would cause the server to return an error as
  data would not be expected which in turn caused libcurl to return
  CURLE_RECV_ERROR.

  This makes the --max-redirs option work as documented.

- parse_proxy: simply memory handling
  
  ... by making sure that the string is always freed after the invoke as
  parse_proxy will always copy the data and this way there's a single
  free() instead of multiple ones.

- parse_proxy: bail out on zero-length proxy names!
  
  The proxy parser function strips off trailing slashes off the proxy name
  which could lead to a mistaken zero length proxy name which would be
  treated as no proxy at all by subsequent functions!
  
  This is now detected and an error is returned. Verified by the new test
  1329.

  configure: don't modify LD_LIBRARY_PATH for cross compiles

- --ssl-allow-beast added
  
  This new option tells curl to not work around a security flaw in the
  SSL3 and TLS1.0 protocols. It uses the new libcurl option
  CURLOPT_SSL_OPTIONS with the CURLSSLOPT_ALLOW_BEAST bit set.

- CURLOPT_SSL_OPTIONS: added
  
  Allow an appliction to set libcurl specific SSL options. The first and
  only options supported right now is CURLSSLOPT_ALLOW_BEAST.
  
  It will make libcurl to disable any work-arounds the underlying SSL
  library may have to address a known security flaw in the SSL3 and TLS1.0
  protocol versions.
  
  This is a reaction to us unconditionally removing that behavior after
  this security advisory:
  
  http://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20120124B.html
  
  ... it did however cause a lot of programs to fail because of old

  curl: use new library-side TCP_KEEPALIVE options
  
  Use the new library CURLOPT_TCP_KEEPALIVE rather than disabling this via

  CURLOPT_TCP_KEEPIDLE and CURLOPT_TCP_KEEPINTVL.

- [Dave Reisner brought this change]

  add library support for tuning TCP_KEEPALIVE
  
  This adds three new options to control the behavior of TCP keepalives:

  - CURLOPT_TCP_KEEPIDLE: idle time before sending first probe
  - CURLOPT_TCP_KEEPINTVL: delay between successive probes
  
  While not all operating systems support the TCP_KEEPIDLE and
  TCP_KEEPINTVL knobs, the library will still allow these options to be
  set by clients, silently ignoring the values.

  Explicitly link to the nettle/gcrypt libraries
  
  When support for nettle was added in 64f328c787ab, I overlooked
  the fact that AC_CHECK_LIB doesn't add the tested lib to LIBS
  if the check succeeded, if a custom success code block was present.
  (The previous version of the check had an empty block for
  successful checks, adding the lib to LIBS implicitly.)
  
  Therefore, explicitly add either nettle or gcrypt to LIBS, after
  deciding which one to use. Even if they can be linked in
  transitively, it is safer to actually link explicitly to them.
  
  This fixes building with gnutls with linkers that don't allow
  linking transitively, such as for windows.

- gnutls: enforced use of SSLv3
  
  With advice from Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos, changed the priority string to
  add "actual priorities" and favour ARCFOUR. This makes libcurl work

- tests: test CRLF in URLs
  
  Related to the security vulnerability: CVE-2012-0036
  
  Bug: http://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20120124.html

- URL sanitize: reject URLs containing bad data
  
  Protocols (IMAP, POP3 and SMTP) that use the path part of a URL in a
  decoded manner now use the new Curl_urldecode() function to reject URLs
  with embedded control codes (anything that is or decodes to a byte value
  less than 32).
  
  URLs containing such codes could easily otherwise be used to do harm and
  allow users to do unintended actions with otherwise innocent tools and
  applications. Like for example using a URL like
  pop3://pop3.example.com/1%0d%0aDELE%201 when the app wants a URL to get
  a mail and instead this would delete one.
  
  This flaw is considered a security vulnerability: CVE-2012-0036
  
  Security advisory at: http://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20120124.html
  
  Reported by: Dan Fandrich

- OpenSSL: don't disable security work-around
  
  OpenSSL added a work-around for a SSL 3.0/TLS 1.0 CBC vulnerability
  (http://www.openssl.org/~bodo/tls-cbc.txt). In 0.9.6e they added a bit
  to SSL_OP_ALL that _disables_ that work-around despite the fact that
  SSL_OP_ALL is documented to do "rather harmless" workarounds.
  
  The libcurl code uses the SSL_OP_ALL define and thus logically always
  disables the OpenSSL fix.
  
  In order to keep the secure work-around workding, the
  SSL_OP_DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS bit must not be set and this change
  makes sure of this.

- libcurl docs: add the new FTP accept option + errors

- timeleft_accept: ack global timeout, moved to ftp.c
  
  First off the timeout for accepting a server connect back must of course
  respect a global timeout. Then the timeleft function is only used by ftp

- libcurl-tutorial.3: curl doesn't sent pragma no-cache

- FTP: move FTP-specific struct field to ftpc_conn
  
  "wait_data_conn" was added to the connectionbits in commit c834213ad5 for
  handling active FTP connections but as it is purely FTP specific and now
  only ever accessed by ftp.c I moved it into the FTP connection struct.

- non-blocking active FTP: cleanup multi state usage
  
  Backpedaled out the funny double-change of state in the multi state
  machine by adding a new argument to the do_more() function to signal
  completion. This way it can remain in the DO_MORE state properly until
  done. Long term, the entire DO_MORE logic should be moved into the FTP
  code and be hidden from the multi code as the logic is only used for
  FTP.

- [Gokhan Sengun brought this change]

  FTP: perform active connections non-blocking
  
  1- Two new error codes are introduced.
  
  CURLE_FTP_ACCEPT_FAILED to be set whenever ACCEPTing fails because of
  FTP server connected.
  
  CURLE_FTP_ACCEPT_TIMEOUT to be set whenever ACCEPTing timeouts.
  
  Neither of these errors are considered fatal and control connection
  remains OK because it could just be a firewall blocking server to
  connect to the client.
  
  2- One new setopt option was introduced.
  
  CURLOPT_ACCEPTTIMEOUT_MS
  
  It sets the maximum amount of time FTP client is going to wait for a
  server to connect. Internal default accept timeout is 60 seconds.

- sockets: new Curl_socket_check() can wait for 3 sockets

  curl.h: add __ANDROID__ macro check

    /path/to/arm-linux-androideabi-gcc -E -dM - < /dev/null \

    #define __ANDROID__ 1
  
  We really need to check both ANDROID and __ANDROID__ since I've observed
  that:
  
  * if you use Android.mk file(s) and the 'ndk-build' script (aka vanilla
  way), ANDROID is predefined (see -DANDROID extra C flag),
  
  * if you use the Android Standalone Toolchain, then __ANDROID__ is
  predefined as stated by the compiler

- lib500: verify timers relative each other
  
  As commit ce896875f8 fixed a timer that accidentally had been moved in
  code and then returned a bad timer, the lib500.c code (used in test 500
  and some others) now verifies 5 timers against each other to verify that
  they have the correct relative values. We cannot compare against
  absolute values as the timings will vary a lot.

- Curl_pgrsTime: store now in an auto variable
  
  It makes it easier to introduce debug outputs in this function, and
  everything in the function is using the value anyway so it might even be
  more efficient.

- timer: restore PRETRANSFER timing
  
  Regression introduced in 7.23.0 with commit 9dd85bce. The function in
  which the PRETRANSFER time stamp was recorded was moved in time causing
  it be stored very quickly after the start timestamp. On most systems
  shorter than 1 millisecond and thus it wouldn't even show with -w
  "%{time_pretransfer}" using the command line tool.

  CURLOPT_INTERFACE: avoid resolving interfaces names
  
  Do not try to resolve interfaces names via DNS by recognizing interface
  names in a few ways.  If the interface option argument has a prefix of
  "if!" then treat the argument as only an interface.  Similarly, if the
  interface argument is the name of an interface (even if it does not have
  an IP address assigned), treat it as an interface name.  Finally, if the
  interface argument is prefixed by "host!" treat it as a hostname that
  must be resolved by /etc/hosts or DNS.
  
  These changes allow a client using the multi interfaces to avoid
  blocking on name resolution if the interface loses its IP address or
  disappears.

  OPENSSL_NO_SSL2 define as it seems some people report it not being
  defined properly in the OpenSSL headers.

- CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT: default is 300 seconds
  
  If the option is set to 0, the default timeout will be used - which in
  modern libcurl versions equals 300 seconds (== 5 minutes).

  progress function example: include timed interval
  
  Adds a timer based off of CURLINFO_TOTAL_TIME that is used to perform
  certain actions after a minimum amount of time has passed using the
  progress function. As a consequence the curl handle is now also passed
  into the progress function. Progress example now also includes an
  example of how to retreive the TOTAL_TIME and print it out.

- SSH: fix CURLOPT_SSH_HOST_PUBLIC_KEY_MD5
  
  When a 32 digit hex key is given as a hostkey md5 checksum, the code
  would still run it against the knownhost check and not properly
  acknowledge that the md5 should then be the sole guide for.
  
  The verbose output now includes the evaluated MD5 hostkey checksum.
  
  Some related source code comments were also updated.

- Curl_resolver_is_resolved: differentiate between host/proxy errors
  
  As there are different return codes for host vs proxy errors, this function
  now properly returns the code properly depending on what was attempted to get
  resolved.

- c-ares: return proxy failure for all proxy types
  
  When making a distinction which return code to return, the code previously
  only regarded HTTP proxies to be proxies and thus return host-related errors
  for failures on other proxy types than HTTP. Now all proxy types will be
  considered proxies...

- FTP: close callback fix
  
  Keep track of which sockets that are the result of accept() calls and
  refuse to call the closesocket callback for those sockets. Test case 596
  now verifies that the open socket callback is called the same number of
  times as the closed socket callback for active FTP connections.

- FTP: call opensocket callback properly
  
  When the new socket is created for an active connection, it is now done
  using the open socket callback.
  
  Test case 596 was modified to run fine, although it hides the fact that
  the close callback is still called too many times, as it also gets
  called for closing sockets that were created with accept().

- Curl_socket: internal replacement for socket()
  
  Moved out into a separate function to work as a "generic" socket()
  replacement.

- test: verify the opensocket callback for FTP
  
  test 595: for passive FTP
  test 596: for active FTP

  CURLOPT_DNS_SERVERS: set name servers if possible (fix)
  
  Ensure that CURLE_OK is returned if setting the name servers is successfull.

- multi interface: only use non-NULL function pointer!
  
  If the socket callback function pointer hasn't been set, we must not
  attempt to use it. Commit adc88ca20 made it more likely to occur.

  multi: handle timeouts on DNS servers by checking for new sockets
  
  If the first name server is not available, the multi interface does
  not invoke the socket_cb when the DNS request to the first name server
  timesout.  Ensure that the list of sockets are always updated after
  calling Curl_resolver_is_resolved.
  
  This bug can be reproduced if Curl is complied with --enable_ares and
  your code uses the multi socket interfaces and the
  CURLMOPT_SOCKETFUNCTION option.  To test try:
    iptables -I INPUT \
             -s $(sed -n -e '/name/{s/.* //p;q}' /etc/resolv.conf)/32 \
             -j REJECT
  and then run a program which uses the multi-interface.
